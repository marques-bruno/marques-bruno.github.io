    <li class="preciousplastic justified"><a href="https://preciousplastic.com/"><strong>Precious Plastic</strong></a> is a growing community of smart people working towards a solution to plastic pollution! They provide blueprints for filament extruders, plastic shredders, injection molding etc. and help you connect with the community around you.<br/><br/></li>
    <li class="prusa justified"><a href="https://prusa3d.com"><strong>Prusa Research</strong></a> No introduction needed for this company, that works both on hardware and software development to bring 3D printers to the DIY community<br/><br/></li>
    <li class="e3d justified"><a href="https://e3d-online.com"><strong>e3d-online</strong></a> The market leader for the best HotEnds for FDM printers. Most importantly, they are working on a [great toolchanging 3D printer with a kickass motion system](https://e3d-online.com/tool-changer-join-the-queue). The project is in beta but it's worth a look!: <br/><br/></li>
    <li class="shadok justified"><a href="https://www.av-lab.net"><strong>Le FabLab du Shadok</strong></a> is my local FabLab. They provide CNC routers, laser cutters, multiple 3D printers etc. A great spot to reach the local DIY community.<br/><br/></li>
    <li class="toms3d justified"><a href="https://toms3d.org/"><strong>Thomas Sanladerer</strong></a> One of my favourite youtuber, he makes great videos about 3D printing, reliable reviews and comes up with nice projects. He's the initial creator of the Dolly, a <a href="/2017/12/10/dolly.html">Prusa MK2 clone that I replicated</a>.<br/><br/></li>
    <li class="makersmuse justified"><a href="https://www.makersmuse.com/"><strong>Maker's Muse</strong></a> is here to "Empower your Creativity through Technology" (mainly 3D printing) and he does so wonderfully. His interest in original mechanisms makes his youtube channel particularily interesting, as you not only learn a lot about 3D printers but also about mechanics, interesting actuation or motion systems, wierd shapes etc. He is also very close to his followers and sometimes gives pro tips on twitter :)<br/><br/></li>
    <li class="cnckitchen justified"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiczXOhGpvoQGhOL16EZiTg/featured"><strong>CNC Kitchen</strong></a> is another great Hobbyist on Youtube. I initially discovered his channel thanks to his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAGFkWkqocI&t=595s">tutorial on topological optimization in Fusion360</a> but his channel is full of projects I'm very much interested in, such as a DIY CNC router, a home-made compression rig etc.<br/><br/></li>
    <li class="pocketnc justified"><a href="http://www.pocketnc.com/">PocketNC</a>: Welcome to the loong awaited world of DIY CNC millling! This startup successfully funded a kickstarted campaign back in 2013 and offer now an awesome 5 axis CNC for the pretty price of $5'500,00. While this is out of my price range, I'm always fascinated by these companies bringing great technologies to the DIY community. Honestly, 5 axis CNCs are definitely not yet machines for the masses, but I really hope that open-source efforts will emerge in the following years, because there is lots of room for improvement both on acessible hardware and software.<br/><br/></li>
