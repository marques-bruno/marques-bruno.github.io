<p class="justified">As you may already know, I am really passionate about climbing! And during the confinement, going to the climbing gym is clearly not an option... So how could I keep up my training, especially my shoulder and finger strength? By building my owner hang board of course!<br/><br/>

As a kid, back in elementary school, my dream job was to work with wood and to become a cabinetmaker... And while that obviously isn't the case anymore, I've always found wood to be a very noble material, and I enjoy working with it even more now that I have a 3D printer, as it made me recognise the value of this beautiful raw product of nature.<br/><br/>

  Back then, my parents recognised my passion for woodworking, and even let me buy with my pocket money a scroll saw. When I moved to Lille, I took advantage of finally having a garage to get my own workshop, and brought back from my parent's place my old scroll saw with me, along with some wood scissors and files, and I finally had a nice project, and some time to put those to good use!<br/><br/>

  To be honest this project was really improvised, and not much thought went into the building process... but I'm happy it worked out very well! I used some joist boards that I salvaged from the workbench I built early 2019 to hook it up in my apartment without damaging the walls, and used an old oak wood board that I found rotting in the basement of my apartment when I moved in<br/>
  I also reused some 8mm threaded rods salvaged from the base of a Prusa MK2 that a friend of mine tossed away, after replacing it with aluminium profiles, to serve as long and robust screws to hold the whole thing together.<br/><br/>

  The result is kind of ugly and unprofessional to be honest, but it's sturdy, practical and I'm now using it everyday!
