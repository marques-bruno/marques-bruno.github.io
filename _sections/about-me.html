<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="assets/images/about-me2.jpg" alt="" /></a>

<p>I hold a Master degree from <a href="https://www.epitech.eu">Epitech</a>, a french private school of expertise in Computer Science.</br>
My studies there were essentially focused on Software development.</br>
</br>
I am now currently working as a R&D Software Engineer in Inria's <a href="https://mimesis.inria.fr">MIMESIS</a> group.</br>
Over the past few years, I've been brought to extend my skills to many areas, from Data acquisition in the operating room to handiwork and DIY projects of varying complexities.</br>
</br>
My time at MIMESIS is mainly spent on my research project, <a href="https://mimesis.inria.fr/projects/endovascular-surgery-fusion/">CIOS Fusion</a>, but a fraction of my time is dedicated to the team, that I help with programming good practices, organization of workgroups and code review sessions. I also use regularly my (mostly self-taught) skills such as CAD designing & prototyping, 3D printing, silicone casting and embedded electronics to help my colleagues with in-silico experiments.</br>
</br>
Aside from work, I love the mountains, hiking and rock climbing (bouldering), but mostly, I am a DIY enthusiast! I hold a particular interest in CNC machines, whether they cut, mill or print.</br>
I love the community aspect of the DIY and open-source world, and hope to, one day, build my own open-source 5-axis CNC platform for CNC tinkers.</br>
